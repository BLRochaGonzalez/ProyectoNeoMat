wiki.prologue = PROLOGUE
wiki.prologue.info = Year 473 after the great war, destroyed countries, civilizations confronted each other under the management of a tyrant. The great war brought to the world death destruction and almost the complete annihilation of the human race, only a few groups of people throughout the planet could be saved. It all started in 2035, the year in which the Russian president died leaving the position to his Vice President, Ivanov, that would be the beginning of the end, Ivanov was an extremely aggressive and unhinged person, he was an unscrupulous young man who wanted only one thing in him world, the Russian supremacy over all nations, and for a moment it succeeded, in an offensive attempt on the United States it came to destroy a large part of the country but at too high a price. Ivanov launched 5 nuclear missiles on the US, the states selected by Ivanov were:New York, Washington D.C., California, Michigan and New Jersey. On the other hand, in the United States they found out about the malicious plans that Ivanov had and decided to counterattack before the missiles arrived, the president decided that it was time to launch everything they had, but not only did they hit Russia, the missiles launched by The US in retaliation against Russia also hit practically all countries. In less than 2 days it had gone from being a \u201Cpeaceful\u201D planet to a planet with the hours counted, the potential for destruction of the two countries was so high that at the time they mutually attacked planet Earth as we knew it, it could disappear, and it did so, both countries attacked each other, that led to the automatic death of the two countries almost completely, only some families could be saved in community and private bunkers, both Russia and the United States had been wiped off the map, already they did not exist. Little by little the consequences of the attacks were reflected in the rest of the world, radiation killed 85% of the population in a matter of hours, the other 15% did not fare better, those who did not kill were seriously injured, of that remaining 15% in a matter of 3 months only 0.05% of the world population remained alive, only 3.5 million people around the world survived. Ivanov was one of them, he achieved hegemony over the entire world at the cost of destroying it, however, although he survived, it would not last long since, due to the strong radiation to which they were all exposed, deaths from unknown diseases were not rare. , and this was what finally took Ivanov once and for all, the survivors left writings that are still remembered today. "Peace unites us after the War that separates us, Life resurfaces when Death attacks us." It is our new motto even so hostilities return to the charge, the world is divided by regions and cities, each one looks for himself and they are able to do whatever it takes to survive, after 2 years, of those 3.5 Millions of people only remained a little more than 2, radiation continued its course and continued the work that Ivanov began, in the end we found a way to live without fear of radiation, we managed to make bubble capsules in which to live in peace at last , or so we thought ...
